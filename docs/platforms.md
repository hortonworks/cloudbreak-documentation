## Platforms


### Manage Platforms (TP)

> This feature is a Technical Preview: it is not ready for production deployment.

You can define reusable "platforms", i.e. platform-related tags that are used to bundle together different configurations. Next, you can attach them to credentials, networks, and templates, creating multi-component platform-specific configurations defining your cluster's infrastructure.

1. You can define platforms in the **manage platform** tab by clicking on **+create platform** and providing required parameters:

    | Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | Enter a name for your platform. |
| Description | (Optional) Enter a description for your platform.|

2. After defining a platform, you will be able to attach a newly created resource (credential, network, or template, and so on) to it. You can apply your platform configuration in the following tabs by specifying your chosen platform. 

You can delete previously defined items using the **delete** option.

For more information, refer to [Platforms](platforms.md).
