## Introduction

Welcome to the **Cloudbreak 2.6 Technical Preview** documentation! 

{!docs/common/about-tp.md!}

Cloudbreak simplifies the provisioning, management, and monitoring of on-demand HDP and HDF clusters in virtual and cloud environments. It leverages cloud infrastructure to create host instances, and uses Apache Ambari via Ambari blueprints to provision and manage HDP clusters. 

Cloudbreak allows you to create clusters using the Cloudbreak web UI, Cloudbreak CLI, and Cloudbreak REST API. Clusters can be launched on public cloud infrastructure platforms **Microsoft Azure**, **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, and on the private cloud infrastructure platform **OpenStack**.

### Primary use cases

Cloudbreak allows you to create, manage, and monitor your HDP and HDF clusters on your chosen cloud platform:

* Dynamically deploy, configure, and manage clusters on public and private clouds (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, OpenStack).   
* Use automated scaling to seamlessly manage elasticity requirements as cluster workloads change.  
* Secure your cluster by enabling Kerberos.   

### Default cluster configurations

Cloudbreak includes default cluster configurations (in the form of blueprints) and supports using your own custom cluster configurations (in the form of custom blueprints).

The following default cluster configurations are available:

 

Platform version: **HDP 2.6**

### Core concepts   

Refer to [Architecture](architecture.md) and [Core concepts](architecture.md#core-concepts).


### Get started

To get started with Cloudbreak:

1. Select the cloud platform on which you would like to launch Cloudbreak:

    * Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
    * Microsoft Azure  
    * Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
    * OpenStack  
   
1. Select the deployment option. In general, Cloudbreak offers a quickstart option and an advanced deployment option.  


#### Deployment options on AWS 

There are two basic deployment options:

* [AWS quickstart option](aws-launch.md): Instantiate Cloudbreak by using the CloudFormation template. This is the basic deployment option and the easiest to get started with.   
* [Advanced Option](vm-launch.md): Install the Cloudbreak deployer on your own VM. This is an advanced deployment option. Select this option if you have custom requirements. The supported operating systems are RHEL, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7 (64-bit).

#### Deployment options on Azure 

* [Azure quickstart option](azure-launch.md): Instantiate Cloudbreak by using ???. This is the basic deployment option and the easiest to get started with. 
* [Advanced Option](vm-launch.md): Install the Cloudbreak deployer on your own VM. This is an advanced deployment option.</p> <p>Select this option if you have custom requirements. The supported operating systems are RHEL, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7 (64-bit).

#### Deployment options on GCP  

* [GCP quickstart option](gcp-launch.md): Instantiate Cloudbreak using ???. This is the basic deployment option and the easiest to get started with.   
* [Advanced Option](vm-launch.md): Install the Cloudbreak deployer on your own VM. This is an advanced deployment option. Select this option if you have custom requirements. The supported operating systems are RHEL, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7 (64-bit).

#### Deployment options on OpenStack  

You must launch Cloudbreak manually on **OpenStack**. Refer to [Launch on OpenStack](os-launch.md). This is an advanced deployment option. Select this option if you have custom VM requirements. The supported operating systems are RHEL, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7 (64-bit).


#### Launch Cloudbreak 

**(Quickstart Option)** You can launch Cloudbreak from a template:  

* [Launch on AWS](aws-launch.md)  
* [Launch on Azure](azure-launch.md) 
* [Launch on GCP](gcp-launch.md)  

> This option is not available for **OpenStack**; you must launch Cloudbreak manually. Refer to [Launch on OpenStack](os-launch.md).    
     
**(Advanced Option)** Or you can launch Cloudbreak [on your own VM](vm-launch.md) on one of these cloud platforms. This is an advanced deployment option that you should only use if you have custom requirements. 

In general, the steps include meeting the prerequisites, launching Cloudbreak on a VM, and creating the Cloudbreak credential. After performing these steps, you can create a cluster based on one of the default blueprints or upload your own blueprint and then create a cluster.
