#### Ambari Server Master Key 

If you plan to configure Ambari to retain the Kerberos KDC admin account credentials when configuring Kerberos, or you wish to encrypt the Ambari database and LDAP server passwords, you need to setup encryption for the passwords stored in the Ambari database. If you plan to do that, enter the Ambari server master key to set up Ambari server with password encryption.
