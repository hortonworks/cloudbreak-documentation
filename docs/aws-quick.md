## Quickstart on AWS

This quickstart documentation will help you get started with Cloudbreak. 

### Prerequisites   

In order to launch Cloudbreak from the CloudFormation template you must:

* Have an existing an AWS account. If you don't have an account, you can create one at [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/).

* Import an existing SSH key pair or generate a new key pair in the AWS region which you are planning to use for launching Cloudbreak and clusters. If you don't have a key pair, refer to [SSH key pair](aws-launch.md#ssh-key-pair) documentation to create or import a key pair.

### Launch Cloudbreak from the Quickstart Template  

Launch Cloudbreak from a CloudFormation template by using the following steps. This is the quickstart deployment option. 

**Steps** 

1. Click on the link to launch the CloudFormation template that will create the AWS resources, including an EC2 Instance running Cloudbreak:

1. The **Create stack** wizard is launched in the Amazon CloudFormation management console:  

1. You do not need to change any template parameters on the **Select Template** page, but check the region name in the top right corner to confirm the region in which you want to launch Cloudbreak:  

    <a href="../images/cb_aws-01.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/cb_aws-01.png" width="650" title="IAM Console"></a>  
    
    > If needed, you may change the region if needed by using the dropdown in the top right corner.

1. Click **Next** to display the **Specify Details** page.

1. On the the **Specify Details** page, enter the following information:

    <a href="../images/cb_aws-02.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/cb_aws-02.png" width="650" title="IAM Console"></a> 

    **Specify Details** section 

    | Parameter | Description |
    |---|---|
    | Stack name | Enter name for your stack. It must be unique in your AWS environment. |

    **General Configuration** 

    | Parameter | Description |
    |---|---|
    | Controller Instance Type | EC2 instance type to use for the cloud controller. |
    | Email Address | Username for the Admin login. Must be a valid email address. |
    | Admin Password | Password for Admin login. Must be at least 8 characters containing letters, numbers, and symbols. |
    
    **Security Configuration** 
        
    | Parameter | Description |    
    |---|---|
    | SSH Key Name | Name of an existing EC2 key pair to enable SSH to access the instances. Key pairs are region-specific, so only the key pairs that you created for a selected region will appear in the dropdown.If you don't have a key pair, refer to [SSH key pair](aws-launch.md#ssh-key-pair). |
    | Remote Access | Allow connections to the cloud controller ports from this address range. Must be a valid <a href="http://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr" target="_blank">CIDR IP</a>. For example: <ul><li>192.168.27.0/24 will allow access from 192.168.27.0 through 192.168.27.255.</li><li>192.168.27.10/32 will allow access from 192.168.27.10.</li><li>0.0.0.0/0 will allow access from all.</li></ul> Refer to [Network security](security.md#network-security) for more information on the inbound ports that are used with Cloudbreak. |

1. Click **Next**  to display the **Options** page.    

1. On he **Options** page, if you expand the **Advanced** section, there is an option to **Rollback on failure**. 
    * By
    default, this option is set to **Yes**, which means that if there are any event failures when creating
    the stack, all the AWS resources created so far are deleted (i.e rolled back) to avoid unnecessary charges. 
    * If you set this option to **No**, if there are any event failures when creating
    the stack, the
    resources are left intact (i.e. not rolled back). Select the **No** option to aid in
    troubleshooting. Note that in this case you are responsible for deleting the stack later.
    
[Comment]: <> (What about providing Permissions > IAM Role? Currently, it seems like CloudbreakRole is created by default. But this did not work well in HDCloud.)    
    
1. Click **Next** to display the **Review** page.
       
1. On the **Review** page, click the **I acknowledge...** checkbox.  

1. Click **Create**.

    > The **Stack Name** is shown in the table with a <span class="cfn-output">CREATE_IN_PROGRESS</span> status. You can click on the **Stack Name** and see the specific events that are in progress. The create process takes about 10 minutes and once ready, you will see <span class="cfn-output2">CREATE_COMPLETE</span>.

### Access Cloudbreak Web UI 

Follow these steps to obtain Cloudbreak VM's public IP address and log in to the Cloudbreak web UI. 

**Steps**     
    
1. Once the stack creation is complete, Cloudbreak is ready to use. You can obtain the URL to Cloudbreak from the **Outputs** tab:

    <a href="../images/cb_aws-05.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/cb_aws-05.png" width="650" title="CFN Console - Outputs"></a>

    > If the Outputs tab is blank, refresh the page.

1. Paste the link in your browser's address bar.

1. Log in to the Cloudbreak web UI using the credential that you configured in the CloudFormation template.

1. Upon a successful login, you are redirected to the dashboard.
       
        
### Create Cloudbreak Credential

Before you can start using Cloudbreak to create clusters, you must create a Cloudbreak credential. Cloudbreak credential allows Cloudbreak to authenticate with your AWS account and provision resources on your behalf.
