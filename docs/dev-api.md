## Cloudbreak APIs

Cloudbreak is a RESTful application development platform whose goal is to help developers deploy HDP clusters in various cloud environments. Once Cloudbreak is deployed in your favorite servlet container, it exposes REST APIs, allowing you to spin up Hadoop clusters of any size with your chosen cloud provider.
