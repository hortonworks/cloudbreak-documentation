## Configuring Custom hostnames based on Domain Name System (DNS)

It's is possible to have different hostnames for cluster members other than the ones configured by the service provider by default.
When the cluster member machines are spun up they try to make a reverse DNS lookup (by querying of the DNS to determine the domain name associated with a specific IP address) and if it returns a valid value, then it is set as hostname.

### Configure reverse DNS on AWS

On AWS you have the following two options:

* use [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) as DNS provider
* setup your own DNS server in your VPC

Both setups require the customer to have a VPC and attach a custom [DHCP option](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) to it.

#### Using Route53


1. **Create or bring your own VPC**
    1. CIDR eg. *10.1.0.0/16*
    2. Enable DNS resolution and **DNS hostnames**
    3. Create a subnet with CIDR eg. *10.1.1.0/28*
    > Notice that you might want to set an Internet Gateway for the VPC and add a default route to the routing table for the IGW.
    Also you may enable *Auto-assign Public IP* option.
    This way Cloudbreak would reach the cluster from outside of the VPC and the cluster would have internet access.
2. **Setup DHCP options**
    1. Create a DHCP Option Set as documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/dhcp_options_set.html).
    2. Set the domain name to a preferred domain, eg. cloudbreak.beer
    3. Set domain name servers to AmazonProviderDNS

    4. Go back to your VPC view and click on *Actions -> Edit DHCP Options Set* to be able select the newly created DHCP Option Set for the VPC

3. **Configure domain at Route53**
    1. Go to the Route53 service page in AWS console
    2. Create a Hosted Zone as documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zone-private-creating.html)
        * with the Domain Name used previously with DHCP Options
        * set the Type to *Private Hosted Zone for Amazon VPC*
        * select the VPC ID to which you previously assigned the DHCP option
    3. Add records
        * Go to *Record set*
        * Use *Create Record Set* for every available IP to have a custom name (10.1.1.4-14 if you have the subnet used above)
            * Type: A
            * Name: eg. *b10*
            * Value: eg. *10.1.1.10*

                <a href="../images/aws-route53-record.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/aws-route53-record.png" width="350" title="Domain record for Route53"></a>

    4. Create another hosted zone for reverse DNS lookup.
        * It's domain name should look like this if you used the previous subnet (as reverse DNS lookups use the special domain *in-addr.arpa*):

            <pre>1.1.10.in-addr.arpa.</pre>

        * set the Type to *Private Hosted Zone for Amazon VPC*
        * select the VPC ID to which you previously assigned the DHCP option

    5. Add records (for every created domain)
        * Type: PTR
        * Name: is the IP last part eg. *10*
        * Value: the domain name you set in the previous step eg. *b10*

4. **Create the cluster** in the VPC and you will have the same hostnames set as the domain names.
> Notice that you don't have control the order over the IP addresses leased to the machines, so the names may not be in order.


#### Using custom DNS server

1. **Create or bring your own VPC**
    1. CIDR eg. *10.3.0.0/16*
    2. Enable DNS resolution and **DNS hostnames**
    3. Create a subnet with CIDR eg. *10.3.3.0/28*
    > Notice that you might want to set an Internet Gateway for the VPC and add a default route to the routing table for the IGW.
    Also you may enable *Auto-assign Public IP* option.
    This way Cloudbreak would reach the cluster from outside of the VPC and the cluster would have internet access.
2. **Setup DNS server** in your VPC/subnet
    1. In the configuration ensure that you have DNS records and reverse DNS pointers for all IP address (eg. 10.3.3.4-14)
    2. Example unbound configuration:

        <pre>
            [root@ip-10-3-3-9 conf.d]# cat 00-cloudbreak.cloud.conf
            server:
                local-zone: "cloudbreak.cloud." static
                local-data: "aww1.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.4"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.4 aww1.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww2.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.5"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.5 aww2.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww3.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.6"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.6 aww3.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww4.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.7"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.7 aww4.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww5.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.8"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.8 aww5.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww6.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.9"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.9 aww6.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww7.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.10"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.10 aww7.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww8.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.11"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.11 aww8.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww9.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.12"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.12 aww9.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww10.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.13"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.13 aww10.cloudbreak.cloud."
                local-data: "aww11.cloudbreak.cloud. IN A 10.3.3.14"
                local-data-ptr: "10.3.3.14 aww11.cloudbreak.cloud."
        </pre>

3. **Setup DHCP options**
    1. Set the domain name to a preferred domain, eg. cloudbreak.cloud
    2. Set domain name servers to the previously created DNS server

    3. Go back to your VPC view and click on *Actions -> Edit DHCP Options Set* to be able select the newly created DHCP Option Set for the VPC

4. **Create the cluster** in the VPC and you will have the same hostnames set as the domain names.
> Notice that you don't have control the order over the IP address leased to the machines, so the names may not be in order.
