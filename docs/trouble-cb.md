## Troubleshooting Cloudbreak

This section includes common errors and steps to resolve them. 


### Invalid PUBLIC_IP in CBD Profile

The `PUBLIC_IP` property must be set in the cbd Profile file or else you wonâ€™t be able to log in on the Cloudbreak UI. 

If you are migrating your instance, make sure that after the start the IP remains valid. If you need to edit the `PUBLIC_IP` property in Profile, make sure to restart Cloudbreak using `cbd restart`.


### Cbd cannot get VM's public IP 

By default the `cbd` tool tries to get the VM's public IP to bind Cloudbreak UI to it. But if `cbd` cannot get the IP address during the initialization, you must set it manually. Check your `Profile` and if `PUBLIC_IP` is not set, add the `PUBLIC_IP` variable and set it to the public IP of the VM. For example: 

<pre>export PUBLIC_IP=192.134.23.10</pre>


### Permission or connection problems 

[comment]: <> (Not sure what this refers to. It came from the Install on Your Own VM docs.)

If you face permission or connection issues, disable SELinux:

1. Set `SELINUX=disabled` in `/etc/selinux/config`.  
2. Reboot the machine.  
3. Ensure the SELinux is not turned on afterwards:

    <presetenforce 0 && sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/ selinux/config</pre>
