## Security Overview

Cloudbreak utilizes cloud provider security resources such as virtual networks, security groups, and identity and access management:

1. **Network isolation** is achieved via user-configured virtual networks and subnets.  
    Read more about [Virtual Networks](#virtual-networks).  
2. **Network security** is achieved via out-of-the-box security group settings.  
    Read more about [Network Security](#network-security).   
3. **Controlled use of cloud resources** using IAM roles (AWS, GCP) or Active Directory (in case of Azure).

### Virtual Networks

Cloud providers use virtual networks which resemble traditional networks. Depending on the options that you selected during deployment, your Cloudbreak instance and clusters are launched into new or existing cloud provider networking infrastructure (virtual networks and subnets). For more information about virtual networks, refer to the cloud-provider documentation:
  
| Cloud Provider | Documentation Link |
|---|---|
| AWS | [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/) |
| Azure | [Virtual network (VNet)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) |
| Google Cloud Platform | [VPC network](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc/) |
| OpenStack | [Network](https://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/networking-guide/intro-os-networking.html) |

### Network Security 

Security groups are set up to control network traffic to the instances in the system. By default, the system is configured to restrict inbound network traffic to the minimal set of ports. You can add or modify rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances: you can do this either when creating your cluster or when the cluster is already running.  

The following table lists the minimum security group port configuration required for the Cloudbreak instance:

| Inbound Port | Description |
|---|---|
| 22 | SSH access to the Cloudbreak VM. |
| 80 | HTTP access to the Cloudbreak UI. |

[comment]: <> (How about cluster security groups? I see plenty of ports open on master and worker security groups.)


### Identity Management

To securely control access to cloud resources, cloud providers use identity management services such as IAM roles (AWS and GCP) and Active Directory (Azure). 

| Cloud Provider | Documentation Link | 
|---|---|
| AWS | [IAM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) |
| Azure | [Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) | 
| Google | [IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) | 
| OpenStack | [Keystone](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/pike/) |

Cloudbreak utilizes cloud providerâ€™s identity management services via Cloudbreak credential. After launching Cloudbreak on your chosen cloud provider, you must create a Cloudbreak credential, which allows Cloudbreak to authenticate with your cloud provider identity management service. Only after you have completed this step, Cloudbreak can create resources on your behalf. 


#### Authentication with AWS

When launching Cloudbreak on AWS, you must select a way for Cloudbreak to authenticate with your AWS account and create resources on your behalf. While key-based authentication uses your AWS access key and secret key, role-based authentication uses IAM roles.

#### Authentication with Azure

After launching Cloudbread on Azure, you are required to create a Cloudbreak credential, which allows Cloudbreak to authenticate with your Azure Active Directory. 

You have two options:

* Interactive: The app and service principal creation and role assignment are fully automated, so the only input that you need to provide to Cloudbreak is your Subscription ID and Directory ID. 

* App-based: The app and service principal creation and role assignment are not automated You must create an Azure Active Directory application registration and then provide its parameters to Cloudbreak, in addition to providing your Subscription ID and Directory ID.

#### Authentication with GCP

After launching Cloudbreak on GCP, you are required to register a service account in Cloudbrak via creating a Cloudbreak credential. Cloudbreak uses this account to authenticate with the GCP identity management service.

#### Authentication with OpenStack 

After launching Cloudbread on OpenStack, you are required to create a Cloudbreak credential, which allows Cloudbreak to authenticate with keystone.
